In this project, we utilize Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze educational and standardized test data with the aim of revealing evident patterns in school performance. This is achieved through data aggregation and computation of crucial metrics, which are then organized into DataFrames.

The project encompasses the following components:

District Overview: A condensed overview of vital district metrics, neatly presented in a DataFrame. School Overview: A DataFrame providing a comprehensive summary of essential metrics for each individual school. Top-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing): A presentation of the top five schools, ranked by their overall passing percentage. Bottom-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing): A display of the lowest-performing five schools based on overall passing percentages. Math Scores by Grade: A DataFrame that compiles the average math scores for students in each grade level at every school. Reading Scores by Grade: A DataFrame showcasing the average reading scores for students in each grade level at each school. Performance by School Spending: A DataFrame that dissects school performance, categorizing it based on average spending ranges per student. Performance by School Size: A DataFrame that analyzes school performance in relation to school size. Performance by School Type: A DataFrame illustrating school performance relative to school type.

The final outcome is a Jupyter notebook housed within the PyCitySchools directory. This directory also contains the requisite CSV files utilized for this project. For a more comprehensive understanding of the project's outcomes, the report.txt file offers an in-depth analysis.
